# income-expense app

Income and Expenses are shown in a separate table.
A separate form was used to enter expense information. Expense description, date and expense amount can be entered.
Incorrect data entry to inputs is prevented.
Submit button feature is used.
Bootstrap was used in the page design.
Income and expense information has been recorded in the localstorage field. In this way, information is not lost when the page is refreshed.
I hope you will like it.
The images of the page and the working video are as follows
